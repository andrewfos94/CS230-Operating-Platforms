# CS230-Operating-Platforms


    Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
      The Gaming Room was looking to create a video game app called Draw It or Lose It, available in different operating systems like iOS, Android, Windows, and Mac PC.
    
    What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
    
      My recommendations were done relatively well, but my inexperience in several operating systems was likely hindering my ability to offer proper explanations on each operating system.
   
   
    What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
    
      The design document certainly helped in following a set process to design the code. Understanding how each class is connected, and how each class should work from another, was incredibly beneficial. Furthermore, it allowed me to keep in mind what the client is looking for and how they would like it to be designed.
    
    If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
    
    I would certainly revise my evaluation section. I believe there is significant improvements that could have been made, but at the time I was not as familiar with each operating system.
    
    How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
    
    The client's desires are the ultimate goal. Meeting these desires is the only thing that matters, within reason. If you do not meet the user's needs when designing code, you risk losing a business partner. Of course, not all desires are reasonable. In this case, providing alternatives and explanations is important.
    
    
    How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
    
    Maintaining clear and concise code, meeting the expectation of the client, and including comments in the code to allow it to be built upon by future developers is important.
